Inspired by tools like Monday.com, AgileFlow organizes your work into boards, where each board represents a project, a workstream, or any collection of related tasks. Every board is a structured workspace with rows of tasks, customizable columns for tracking data, and groups that let you categorize work into meaningful sections. The result is a flexible system that adapts to how your team actually works, whether you follow Scrum, Kanban, or your own hybrid methodology.',
